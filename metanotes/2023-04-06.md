# 2nd session

After another 2h session:

- Ppl got mentally tired after 1.5 hours
- Needed a recap of previous thing
- Interested in demonstrations of where you would use Python

- When I switched to showing demos in VS Code, ppl were worried that Thonny wasn't a "legit" or professional thing to use

> Obviously this isn't true, but since I'm used to VS Code, I think I should rewrite the tutorials to use vscode
