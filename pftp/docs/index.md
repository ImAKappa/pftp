# 0 Introduction

This short tutorial series will help you go from **zero** programming experience to writing Clippy, a Python program that augments your clipboard:

1. Modify text on the clipboard (upper, lower, title, sentence cases)
2. Clip sequences of generated text. Useful for writing email templates
3. Quick web searching for clipped text
4. Store up to 2 pieces of text and 2 images

!!! note "Clipboard"

    Your computer likely has a **clipboard**, a temporary storage space for text and images that you copy/cut from other apps like Word or your web browser.

    === "Windows"

        Try clipping `Hello World!` by selecting the highlighted text with your cursor, then pressing `Ctrl-C`.
        Paste the text somewhere else, like your browser search bar or Notepad.

        Then clip `Goodbye universe!` and paste that somewhere else. Notice that the previous text, "Hello World", was replaced with the most recently clipped text.

    === "MacOS"

        Try clipping `Hello World!` by selecting the highlighted text with your cursor, then pressing `Cmd-C`.
        Paste the text somewhere else, like your browser search bar or TextEdit.

        Then clip `Goodbye universe!` and paste that somewhere else. Notice that the previous text, "Hello World", was replaced with the most recently clipped text.



## Prerequisites

While you don't need any prior programming experience, you should own or have access to a computer of some kind.
The computer needs to have an operating system, like Windows 10 or Mac OS, and you should be familiar with how to use the computer to install and run applications.

Also, you should be familiar with:

* Reading and writing in English
* Your keyboard (the `enter`/`return` key, `Ctrl`/`Cmd` keys, letters, numbers, space bar, etc.)
* Using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
* Basic arithmetic (like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing whole and decimal numbers)
