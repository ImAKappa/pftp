# Introduction

This short tutorial series will help you go from **zero** programming experience to writing Python scripts that can solve your indecision, to scripts that can help organize your files and folders.

Here's a complete list of the projects we will complete:

Misc:

1. Solve your indecision by writing a program that will choose for you

Text:

1. Formatting (Title/lower/upper case, trim spaces, etc),
2. Descriptive stats (word and character count, frequency of words, repetitiveness)

Numbers:

1. Custom formulas

Internet

1. Remind yourself to stay hydrated with refreshing water facts
2. Keep track of updates to specific websites

Files and Folders

1. Clean up file names
1. Combine zip files
2. Generate a report of all files that were modified recently in a folder, with support for filters and sorting
3. Organize your messy `Downloads` folder


## Prerequisites

While you don't need any prior programming experience, you should own or have access to a computer of some kind.
The computer needs to have an operating system, like Windows 10 or Mac OS, and you should be familiar with how to use the computer to install and run applications.

Also, you should be familiar with:

* Using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
* Familiar with your keyboard (the `enter`/`return` key, letters, numbers, space bar, etc.)
* Reading and writing in English
* Basic arithmetic (like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing whole and decimal numbers)
