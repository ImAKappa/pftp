## Modules & Packages

A module is a single file. All the scripts we write in these tutorial series are modules.

Packages are a collection of modules. We will _not_ discuss how to write packages,
but we will cover how to use other people's packages.

[Standard lib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) are packages that come installed with Python

Standard library modules we will use in this tutorial

| Module(s) | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| `random`, `math` | Number crunching |
| `datetime` | Handle date and time data |
| `subprocess`, `platform`, `os` | Interact with operating system |
| `pathlib`, `os`, `shutil`, `io` | Manage files |
| `json`, `csv` | Parse file formats |
| `urllib` | Interact with Internet |

Third-party modules we will use
