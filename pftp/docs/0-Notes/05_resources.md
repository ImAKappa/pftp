## üí° What can I do with Python?

Anything from making apps, to data science, to building websites, and more.

Here are some notable examples:

| Application | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web Development | Generating websites ("frontend"), handling logic for website data ("backend") | [Django :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.djangoproject.com/) |
| Machine Learning | Getting computers to figure out solutions to problems on their own | [TensorFlow :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.tensorflow.org/about/case-studies) |
| Scientific computing | Using computers to solve science problems | [NASA project built with Python :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://code.nasa.gov/?q=python) |
| Game Development | Making computer games | [PyGame :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pygame.org/tags/all) |
| Web Scraping | Automatically searching and downloading content from websites | [Amazon scraper :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/scrape-amazon-product-information-beautiful-soup) |
| Cybersecurity & Hacking | Testing security exploits | [Scapy :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://scapy.net/) |

These are some of the main applications, but there are a [whole lot :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://github.com/search?q=python&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc) more things you can do with Python

## üè´ How do I learn Python?

I don't remember everything about writing Python code, so when I forget things I usually:

1. Google what I am trying to do, like [this :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+sort+a+list+in+python)
2. Look through a popular forum called StackOverflow, especially if it's a more complicated problem (like [this :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python))

    - Alternatively, you can google your programming question, then add the word "StackOverflow" to your search query, like [this :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+yield+do+python+stackoverflow)

3. Peruse the official [Python documentation :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://docs.python.org/3/)

!!! note "StackOverflow"

    There's a [running joke :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://youtube.com/shorts/qol2X_8JF9I?feature=share) that a software developer's job is just copy-pasting answers off of StackOverflow

Given Python's popularity, there are an insane amount of beginner-friendly tutorials out there on the internet.
But how do we know which one's are good? Here are my recommendations:

### üé• If you like watching:

1. [Python in a 100 seconds :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7X9w_GIm1s)

    - This video will **not** makes sense the first few times you watch it
    - I put it here because it shows a sample of a lot of the features of Python that _you will eventually learn_
    - The first time you watch it, make note of all the words or concepts you don't understand
    - After spending some time writing Python (maybe after writing 5 - 10 personal projects), revisit this video and make note of things you have learned since the last time you watched it

2. [Corey Schafer's entire YouTube channel :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms)

    - You can start [here :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) 
    - Note that he doesn't use Thonny, but almost all the code he writes will work in Thonny

### üìö If you like reading:

1. [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
   
    - A free book that explains how to make programs that you can use to automate home and office work
    - The author, Al Sweigart, also has a bunch of other well-written, free beginner Python books [here :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://inventwithpython.com/)
  
2. [Composing Programs :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://composingprograms.com/)

    - _Really_ good, **but** more technical than Automate the Boring Stuff, and that can be intimidating
    - Despite this, I think it's important for people to at least be aware of the more technical approach to programming


And that's it. There are a number of other great tutorials for the specific applications mentioned above, but generally I find it can be overwhelming to mention _too_ many resources.

Have fun learning Python!
