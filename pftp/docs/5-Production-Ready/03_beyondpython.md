## Multi-lingual

Learn other languages!

Recommended languages (this will take **several years** to get through, btw):

1. JavaScript - similar difficulty to Python, powers websites
   1. TypeScript - harder, but useful
3. Scala - very similar to Python, but strong, static typing
4. C#, Kotlin, Dart - Object oriented programming 
   1. Java - very similar
5. F#, OCaml - Functional programming
   1. Haskell - harder, but useful
6. Lisp, Clojure, Racket - different, but should learn
   1. Julia - a Lisp-y language similar to Python, learn if interested in scientific computing
7. C - Learn how computers _actually_ work
   1. Assembly - bare-bones programming
8. Rust - Systems programming, concurrency, very difficult
   1. C++ - also very difficult, but for different reasons

Novel and/or Research languages

1. Pony - actor-based concurrency
2. Zig - C alternative
3. Unison - concurrency
4. Lobster, Odin - game dev
5. Austral - linear type system
6. Koka - effectful programming

Weird and Wacky

1. LOLCode
2. Chef
3. BrainFuck
