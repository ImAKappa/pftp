# ðŸ”¨ Python Developer Tools

In summary, these are the tools I typically use for serious Python development:

| Tool | Name |
| --- | --- |
| IDE | VS Code |
| Package manager | `pip` |
| Environment manager | `hatch` |
| Language Server | Pylance (VS Code) |
| Type Checker | Pyright (VS Code) |
| Version Control | `git` |
| Documentation generator | `mkdocs` |
| Package-level Testing | `pytest` |
| Environment-level Testing | `tox` |
| Profiling | `cProfile` |
| Debugging | `pdb` |

## IDE

Feel free to stick to Thonny if you feel comfortable with it. When you don't feel like as much of a beginner, consider trying these popular IDEs:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

2. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## Package management

I use tend to use [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) (although it is an environment manager; `pip` is technically the package manager). Other good alternatives include [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
