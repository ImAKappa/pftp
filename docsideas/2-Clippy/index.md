# Clippy

!!! note "Clipboard"

    Your computer likely has a **clipboard**, a temporary storage space for text and images that you copy/cut from other apps like Word or your web browser.

    === "Windows"

        Try clipping `Hello World!` by selecting the highlighted text with your cursor, then pressing `Ctrl-C`.
        Paste the text somewhere else, like your browser search bar or Notepad.

        Then clip `Goodbye universe!` and paste that somewhere else. Notice that the previous text, "Hello World", was replaced with the most recently clipped text.

    === "MacOS"

        Try clipping `Hello World!` by selecting the highlighted text with your cursor, then pressing `Cmd-C`.
        Paste the text somewhere else, like your browser search bar or TextEdit.

        Then clip `Goodbye universe!` and paste that somewhere else. Notice that the previous text, "Hello World", was replaced with the most recently clipped text.
