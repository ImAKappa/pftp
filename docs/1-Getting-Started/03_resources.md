## üí° Inspiration

Not sure, what to make with Python? You can find lots of [Python projects :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://github.com/search?q=python&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc) on GitHub,
the place where people store their apps, scripts, and libraries.

## üè´ How do I learn Python?

### üèãÔ∏è Exercises

Practice solving problems with Python. There really is no good substitute.
Here are my reccomendations for a beginner:

1. [W3 Python Exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_exercises.asp)
2. [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python)

Also, try to never copy-paste code. Instead, type it all out yourself to better
memorize Python syntax.

### üôè Asking for help

!!! note "Memorizing Python code is useful, but not always necessary"

I don't remember everything about Python, so when I forget things I usually:

1. Google what I am trying to do, like [this :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+sort+a+list+in+python)
2. Look through a popular forum called StackOverflow, especially if it's a more complicated problem (like [this :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python))

    - Alternatively, you can google your programming question, then add the word "StackOverflow" to your search query, like [this :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+yield+do+python+stackoverflow)

3. Peruse the official [Python documentation :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://docs.python.org/3/)

4. Use "cheatsheets". Ideally, you would make your own as you continue to use the language, but just to get started you could use this popular [Python cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)

!!! info "StackOverflow"

    There's a [running joke :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://youtube.com/shorts/qol2X_8JF9I?feature=share) that a software developer's job is just copy-pasting answers off of StackOverflow


Given Python's popularity, there is an insane amount of beginner-friendly tutorials out there on the internet.
But how do we know which one's are good? Here are my recommendations:

### üé• If you like watching

1. [Python in a 100 seconds :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7X9w_GIm1s)

    - This video will **not** makes sense the first few times you watch it
    - I put it here because it shows a sample of a lot of the features of Python that _you will eventually learn_
    - The first time you watch it, make note of all the words or concepts you don't understand
    - After spending some time writing Python (maybe after writing 5 - 10 personal projects), revisit this video and make note of things you have learned since the last time you watched it

2. [Corey Schafer's entire YouTube channel :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms)

    - You can start [here :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) 
    - Note that he doesn't use Thonny, but almost all the code he writes will work in Thonny

3. [Socratica's Python Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-)

    - An interesting, almost cinematic approach to learning Python

4. [mCoding's entire YouTube channel :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/@mCoding)

    - You can start [here :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8NijUYfyus)
    - He talks about beginner and advanced topics

5. [I Gave My Goldfish $50,000 to Trade Stocks](https://youtu.be/USKD3vPD6ZA) by Michael Reeves

    - A very choatic application of Python programming
    - More entertainment than educational, and slightly offensive, but definitely impressive (and inspiring?)

### üìö If you like reading

1. [Think Python :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)

    - An excellent free book that explains how to think like a programmer, and solve problems using Python
    - The approach to programming is similar to this guide (it discusses languages, problem-solving, etc), but it's more in-depth (and better written than my guide, in my opinion)

2. [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart
   
    - A practical free book that explains how to make programs that you can use to automate home and office work
  
3. [Composing Programs :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://composingprograms.com/)

    - _Really_ good, **but** more technical than Automate the Boring Stuff, and that can be intimidating
    - Despite this, I think it's important for people to at least be aware of the more technical approach to programming


And that's it. There are a number of other great tutorials for the specific applications mentioned in the [Welcome](../index.md) page, but generally I find it can be overwhelming to mention _too_ many resources.

Have fun learning Python!
