# ðŸ“” Reading

To write, you must read. Let's practice reading Python code.

## ðŸ”£ Parts of Speech

When using a language, it's helpful to know the parts of speech:

| Part of Speech | English | Part of Speech | Python | Purpose/Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Noun (instance) | that dog over there, this chair | Data | `3`, `"Hello"`, `[1, 2]` | Something that exists |
| Noun (type) | animal, furniture | Data type | `int`, `str`, `list` | A kind or type of thing |
| Pronoun | he, she, they, it, we, us, that, them | Variable | `age`, almost any english word | A placeholder for another thing |
| Verb | Run, repeat | Function | `print`, `range`, `math.sqrt` | An action |
| Conjunction | and, but, or, not | Logical operators | `and`, `or`, `not` | Joins statements with logic |

For each example:

1. Explain in English what you _think_ the code does.
2. Then type the code into the Thonny code editor (**avoid copy-pasting**, it is essential to develop muscle memory for writing Python)
3. Finally, run it to see if you were right

!!! warning "Type everything"

    Type all the examples to better remember Python

## ðŸ“ƒ Cheatsheets

The examples here are purposefully a little more complicated because there are already so many articles, books, and cheatsheets with simple Python examples.

!!! note "You don't have to remember everything"

    If you ever forget how to do something in Python, see the [resources](../05_resources/) section for advice on how to search for help

**Before** and **after** reading this page, I recommend studying (and typing out) the examples at [Python Cheat Sheet :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/).
Ideally, you would work your way through all of the sections over a few weeks or months.
But if you are short on time or energy, read the following in this order:

1. [Basics :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/basics)
2. [Built-in Functions :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/built-in-functions)
3. [Manipulating Strings :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/manipulating-strings)
4. [String formatting :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/string-formatting)
3. [Control Flow :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/control-flow)
4. [Functions :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/functions)
5. [Lists and Tuples :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/lists-and-tuples)
6. [Dictionaries :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/dictionaries)
7. [Sets :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/sets)
8. [Comprehensions Step-by-Step :fontawesome-solid-up-right-from-square:](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/blog/python-comprehensions-step-by-step)

## ðŸ’¬ Comments

Comments are lines of text that the Python interpreter ignores.
You usually write comments to annotate your code so that other people, and your future self, can understand your code.

=== "English"

    Write "Hungry" (this is how I am feeling right now)

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # This is how I am feeling right now
    print("Hungry")
    ```

## Examples

--8<-- "1-Getting-Started/reading.txt"


### Greet

=== "English"

    Write a a hello message

=== "Python"

    ```python
    """Write a a hello message"""
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

### While Loop

=== "English"

    It's a birthday tradition to repeatedly chant "Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you ..."
    all the way up to the actual age of the birthday-person.
    Write a program that simulates this.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    """It's a birthday tradition to repeatedly chant "Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you ..."
    all the way up to the actual age of the birthday-person.
    Write a program that simulates this.
    """
    age = 12
    age_chant = 1

    while age_chant < age:
        print(f"Are you {age_chant}?")
        age_chant = age_chant + 1

    print(f"Happy Birthday! You are {age_chant}!")
    ```

### Structural Pattern Matching

=== "English"

    I have a list of files that I want to categorize. Write a program that will say the kind of each file.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    """I have a list of files that I want to categorize. Write a program that will say the kind of each file."""
    files = ["cute-puppies.png", ""]

    for file in files:
        match file.split("."):
            case [filename, ("png" | "jpg" | "webp" | "svg")]:
                print(f"'{filename}' is an image file")
            case [filename, ("csv" | "txt" | "md")]:
                print(f"'{filename}' is a plain-text file")
            case [filename, "py"]:
                print(f"'{filename}' is Python source code!")
            case _:
                print(f"Not sure what kind of file '{file}' is...")
    ```

### Strings

### Numbers

!!! note "Making numbers easier to read"

    We could write `478862301`, but that's a little tricky to read.
    Lot's of languages have ways to make numbers easier to read, including Python.

    | Language | Separator | Syntax |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | English | comma (`,`) | `478,862,301` |
    | French | period (`.`) | `478.862.301` |
    | **Python** | underscore (`_`) | `478_862_301` |

### Variables

```python title="Binding data to labels"
age = 18
print(f"My age is {age}. In ten years I will be {age + 10}")
```

```python title="Readable variable names"
seconds_per_minute = 60
minutes_per_hour = 60

seconds_per_hour = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour

print(f"There are {seconds_per_hour} seconds in one hour")
```

### Sequences

```python title="Lists"
print(type([1, 2, 3]))
print(type(["a", "b", "c"]))
```

```python title="Sum of list"
print(sum([-1, -1, -1]))
```

```python title="Shorthand sum of list"
print(sum([-1] * 3))
```

```python title="List of numbers"
print(list(range(20)))
print([num for num in range(20)])
```

```python title="More lists of numbers"
print(list(range(0, 20, 2)))
print([num for num in range(20) if num % 2 == 0])
```

```python title="Dictionaries"
jojo = {"name": "Jotaro", "age": 17, "stand": "Star Platinum"}
print(jojo)
print(type(jojo))
print(jojo.keys())
print(jojo.values())
print(jojo.items())
```

### Control Flow

Write a program that will calculate income before and after taxes based on this bracketed tax scheme:

| Tax bracket | Percent tax |
| --- | --- |
| > $220,000 | 33% |
| > $150,000 | 29% |
| > $100,000 | 26% |
| > $50,000 | 20% |
| <= $50,000 | 15% |

```python title="if/elif/else statement"
income = 57456.34
tax = None

if income > 220_000:
    tax = 0.33
elif income > 150_000:
    tax = 0.29
elif income > 100_000:
    tax = 0.26
elif income > 50_000:
    tax = 0.20
elif income >= 0:
    tax = 0.15
else:
    print("Invalid income!")

if tax:
    print(f"Income before taxes: {income}")
    print(f"Income after deducting {tax*100}% taxes: {income * (1.0 - tax)}")
```

---

```python title="For loop"
countries = ["Canada", "India", "Japan", "Germany", "Venezuela", "Kenya"]

for country in countries:
    print(f"I want to visit {country}")
```

```python title="For loop (parallel)"
groceries = {
    "milk": "2 bags",
    "eggs": "1 carton",
    "strawberry shortcake": "1",
}

print("Honey, we need:")

for item, amount in groceries.items():
    print(f" {amount} {item}")
    if "cake" in item:
        print("(Keep it a surprise!)")
```

---

```python title="While loop"
age = 12
age_chant = 1

while age_chant < age:
    print(f"Are you {age_chant}?")
    age_chant = age_chant + 1

print(f"Happy Birthday! You are {age_chant}!")
```

---

I have a list of files that I want to categorize.
Write a program that will say the kind of each file.

```python title="Match"
files = [
    "cute-puppies.png",
    ""
]

match file.split("."):
    case [filename, ("png" | "jpg" | "webp" | "svg")]:
        print(f"'{filename}' is an image file")
    case [filename, ("csv" | "txt" | "md")]:
        print(f"'{filename}' is a plain-text file")
    case [filename, "py"]:
        print(f"'{filename}' is Python source code!")
    case _:
        print(f"Not sure what kind of file '{file}' is...")
```

### Functions

```python title="Basic"
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")

greet("world")
```

```python title="Return a value"
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(F):
    return (float(F) - 32) * (5 / 9)

print(f"100 Fahrenheit is {fahrenheit_to_celsius(100.0)} deg Celsius")
```

```python title="Default value"
def speaker(audio, volume=40.0, on=True):
    if not on:
        return "*silence*"

    if volume > 1000:
        print(" ".join(list(audio.upper())) + " ! ! !")
    elif volume > 50:
        print(audio.upper())
    else:
        print(audio.lower())
    return 

speaker("Hello is this thing on?", on=False)
speaker("Oh, wait, now it's working!")
speaker("Never gonna give you up...", volume=65.0)
speaker("Never gonna let you down...", volume=20.2)
speaker("Never gonna run around and desert you", volume=9000)
```
