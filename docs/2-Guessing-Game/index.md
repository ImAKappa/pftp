# Guessing Game

The best way to learn programming is to just jump into it.
We aboviously don't want to try something something too trivial because
trivial examples are usually pretty useful and don't properly illustrate the utility of programming.

But we also can't try something too hard, else we'll be overwhelmed.
As useful as an automatic analytics report generator might be for your office work,
those are usually fairly complicated (to design well). 

A guessing game is one of the best non-trivial programs to write.



Here we will walk through how to build two guessing games:

1. Number guessing game
2. Word guessing game
