# ðŸ“¨ Clippy

"Clippy" is a Python program that lets you sequentially clip a set of template text to your clipboard.
You can use it to make cookie-cutter emails slightly less tedious to write.

To start, let's make a Python file and fill it with some default code.

```python title="clippy.py" linenums="1"
--8<-- "clippy/01_clippy.py"
```
