Let's get familiar with the two main parts of Thonny.

1. The **code editor**: This is where we will write our Python scripts. We use it like we do Microsoft Word

2. The **REPL**: This stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. This bit is interactive. When we enter a valid Python instruction, we will immediately see the result


!!! note "Code Editors vs Word Processors"

    MS Word and Google Docs are examples of word processors. These apps deal with rich text, which is text that is embellished with lots of extra notation so that it looks different in the user interface of the word processor.

    For example, create a word document then change the file extension from `.docx` to `.zip`.
    Next, extract the contents of the folder and you will see that, under the hood,
    a Word document is actually pretty complicated. The text that you wrote is lost in a sea of extra markup.

    Constrast this with code, which is plain text. This is the kind of text you would write in Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). It's exactly what you type, but there's no extra styling for the text.
