# Programming from Principles

In this previous section we got comfortable with Python by comparing it to human languages.
In other words, we learned Python by **analogy**.

However, programming languages and human languages are fundamentally different things.
Now that we are somewhat familiar with Python, we will take a look at the language from **first principles**.
This means no analogies; instead we understand Python for what it _actually is_.
