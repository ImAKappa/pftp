# Welcome!

This short guide will help you go from **zero** programming experience
to being comfortable writing in Python.

## üêç Why Python?

Python is a language for communicating with your computer.
Knowing Python will empower you to:

1. **Automate repetitive tasks**

    - Getting updates from websites that change over time
    - Moving, renaming, and merging files & folders
    - Formatting, sorting, and organizing text and images

2. **Create apps for work and entertainment**

    - Games: [Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHkF1-73pw), [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/features/), [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/)
    - Websites: [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - Apps: [Kivy](https://kivy.org/), [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
    - 3D Modelling: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) integrates with [Python](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html)
    - Videos: [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)
    - Computer Graphics: [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi)
    - Dashboards: [Dash](https://dash.gallery/Portal/)

3. **Do modelling** (not the fashion kind, although you could [use Python to help you pick out an outfit](https://github.com/sonu275981/Fashion-Recommender-system))

    - Databases
    - Simulations & Scientific Computing: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [PyMC3](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/v3/index.html)
    - Machine learning: [Tensorflow](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com/products/ml?sort=updated), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/community-stories)

If you're most people, you will likely find the most use from **automating repetitive tasks** with Python.
Automation will be our focus for this guide.

## üìñ Reading this guide

Programming is not the easiest thing to learn.
Honestly, it's extremely frustrating at times.
Despite this, it's a very rewarding skill.
It can save you time ‚è≥ and money üíµ, and will improve the way you think and problem-solve üß†.

There are a lot of guides on learning Python. Most of them are ok.
Too many of them assume you know a thing or two about programming.
Too few remember what it is like to not know how to program.
I don't claim my guide is the best place to learn to program with Python,
but I am quite confident that it's a good place to start.

I wrote this for people who have never programmed before,
people whose primary experience using a computer consists of watching videos online, sending emails,
maybe making a spreadsheet now and then or typing up a report.
You don't need to be good at school to read this guide.

However, you **absolutely need**:

1. An open mind
2. To be okay with failure
3. To understand that you can always improve

People _mistakenly_ believe that they are not smart enough to program.

This is **backwards** thinking!

- üèãÔ∏è You are not too weak to go to the gym. You get strong from trying, failing, then trying again at the gym
- üßò You are not too easily distracted to meditate. You gain focus by trying, failing, then trying again to meditate
- ‚úçÔ∏è You are not too bad with words to write. You become eloquent by trying, failing, then trying again to write.
- üßë‚Äçüíª You are not too dumb to program. You get smart by trying, failing, then trying again to program.

## üíΩ Technology Prerequisites

While you don't need any prior programming experience, you should own or have access to a computer of some kind.
The computer needs to have an **operating system**, like Windows 10 or Mac OS, and you should be familiar with how to use the computer to install and run applications.

Also, you should be familiar with:

1. Reading and writing in English
2. Your keyboard (the `enter`/`return` key, `Ctrl`/`Cmd` keys, letters, numbers, space bar, etc.)
3. Using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
4. Navigating a website
