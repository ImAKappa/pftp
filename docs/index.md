# Introduction

This short guide will help you go from **zero** programming experience
to being comfortable writing in Python.

Python is a language for talking to your computer. Knowing Python will empower you to:

1. **Automate repetitive tasks**

    - Getting updates from websites that change over time
    - Moving/renaming/merging files & folders
    - Formatting/sorting/organizing text
    - Reformatting images

2. **Create apps for work and entertainment**

    - Games: [Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHkF1-73pw), [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/features/), [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/)
    - Websites: [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - Apps: [Kivy](https://kivy.org/), [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
    - 3D Modelling: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) integrates with [Python](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html)
    - Videos: [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)
    - Computer Graphics: [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi)
    - Dashboards: [Dash](https://dash.gallery/Portal/)

3. **Modelling** (not the fashion kind, although you could [use Python to help you pick out an outfit](https://github.com/sonu275981/Fashion-Recommender-system))

    - Databases
    - Simulations
    - Machine learning: [Tensorflow](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com/products/ml?sort=updated), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/community-stories)

If you're most people, you will likely find the most use from **automating repetitive tasks** with Python.
Fortunately, this is also the easiest application to get started with and will be our focus for this guide.

> But don't worry, we will create some simple games and simulations near the end of the guide.

## Prerequisites

While you don't need any prior programming experience, you should own or have access to a computer of some kind.
The computer needs to have an operating system, like Windows 10 or Mac OS, and you should be familiar with how to use the computer to install and run applications.

Also, you should be familiar with:

- Reading and writing in English
- Your keyboard (the `enter`/`return` key, `Ctrl`/`Cmd` keys, letters, numbers, space bar, etc.)
- Using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
- Basic arithmetic (like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing whole and decimal numbers)
